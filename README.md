# Lab 2 - Array Manipulation

## Description
This project is a simple shopping list app that demonstrates array manipulation using JavaScript. Users can add items, remove the last item, and search/filter items dynamically.

## Features
- Add items to a shopping list (no duplicates allowed)
- Remove the last item from the list
- Search and filter items in the list (case-insensitive)
- Dynamic update of the list displayed on the webpage

## How to Use
1. Enter an item name in the **Enter item** input field.
2. Click **Add Item** to add it to the list.
3. Click **Remove Last Item** to remove the most recently added item.
4. Use the **Search items** input field to filter the list dynamically.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Reflection
- Used `push()` to add new items and `filter()` to find matching items.
- Ensured case-insensitive search by converting strings to lowercase.
- Planned improvements include debounce for search input and adding item removal functionality.
